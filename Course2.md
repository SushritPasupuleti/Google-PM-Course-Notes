- Measure success of a Project

- Identifying stakeholders

### Cost Benefit Analysis:

Process of adding up the expected value of a project, the benefits and comparing them to the dollar costs.

Identifying Benefits:

- The value the project creates

- How much money could the org save from this ?

- How much money will it bring in from existing customers ?

- How much time will be saved ?

- How will the UX be improved ?

Identifying Costs:

- How much time will people have to spend on the project ?

- One-time costs

- On-going costs

- Long-term costs

Calculating cost and benefits (ROI)

$$\frac{(G - C)}{C} = ROI$$

- *G* is the financial gains projected from the project.

- *C* is the upfront and ongoing costs for the project.

- *ROI* is reported in percentage finally.

### Key Components of Project Initiation

- Goals: What are we trying to achieve

- Scope: Define the work to do to achieve the goal.

- Deliverables: the product or service to ship to meet the scope.

- Success Criteria

- Stakeholders

- Resources

Once the above are sorted, create the `Project Charter` to organize, plan and communicate the things to be done. Stakeholders must approve this before moving forward with the planning phase.

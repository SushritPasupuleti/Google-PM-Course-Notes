# Project Initiation

## Resources

Refer to [README.md](./README.md)

## Overview

- Initiating a Project

- Identifying project scope, goals and deliverables

- Measure success of a Project

- Identifying stakeholders

### Cost Benefit Analysis:

Process of adding up the expected value of a project, the benefits and comparing them to the dollar costs.

Identifying Benefits:

- The value the project creates

- How much money could the org save from this ?

- How much money will it bring in from existing customers ?

- How much time will be saved ?

- How will the UX be improved ?

Identifying Costs:

- How much time will people have to spend on the project ?

- One-time costs

- On-going costs

- Long-term costs

Calculating cost and benefits (ROI)

$$\frac{(G - C)}{C} = ROI$$

- *G* is the financial gains projected from the project.

- *C* is the upfront and ongoing costs for the project.

- *ROI* is reported in percentage finally.

### Key Components of Project Initiation

- Goals: What are we trying to achieve

- Scope: Define the work to do to achieve the goal.

- Deliverables: the product or service to ship to meet the scope.

- Success Criteria

- Stakeholders

- Resources

Once the above are sorted, create the `Project Charter` to organize, plan and communicate the things to be done. Stakeholders must approve this before moving forward with the planning phase.

### Project Goals & Deliverables

Project Goal: Desired outcome of the project.

- Must be well defined

- Agreed upon by all stakeholders.

Deliverables: Help measure and recognize the project's impact. (Tangible outcome)

- Decided together with all stakeholders.

- Ensure it lines up with the vision of the project.

### SMART Goals

Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound methods used to evaluate project goals.

Specific: Should answer atleast 2 questions about the following:

	- The desired accomplishments

	- The reasons behind the goal

	- Specific purpose or benefits

	- People who are involved

	- Recipients

	- Where to deliver

	- Requirements and Constants

- Measurable:
	
	- Metrics which can be numbers or figures.

	- How much, how many, when ?

- Attainable:

	- How can it be accomplished ?

	- Should encourage growth but not too extreme

- Relevant:

	- Effort and benefits should be balanced.

	- Goal should match org vision, values and be worthwhile

	- Timing, both amount of time to complete the project and sustaining it over time must have big impacts.

- Time-bound:

	- Goal has a deadline

### OKRs (Objective & Key Results)

Similar to SMART, they help establish and clairfy goals or objectives for a project.

**Objective**: Desire outcome

	- Aspirtational

	- Aligned with Job goals

	- Action-oriented

	- Concrete

	- Significant

Questions for Objectives:

	- Does the objective help achieve the project goals ?

	- Does the objective algin with company OKRs

	- Is the objective motivational and inspiring ?

	- Will achieving the objective make a significant impact ?

**Key Results**: Ways of knowing if the Objetive has been met.

	- Result-oriented

	- Measurable and verifiable

	- Specific and Time-bound

	- Aggressive yet realistic

Questions for KRs:

	- What does success mean ?

	- What metrics would prove that we've succeeded ?

Levels of OKRs:

- Company-Level: Shared with everyone in org, and are updated to keep entire org on track. Support the mission of the organization

- Project-Level: Set during initial phase. Will dictate how goals are measured and tracked throughout the lifecycleof the project.

Example:

Objective: Improve Sales

Key Result: Achieve 10% greater sales than last quarter by end of this quarter.

# Project Planning

**Overview**

- Kicking-off the planning phase

- Setting and reaching milestones, and identifying tasks

- Budgeting process

- Identifying and planning for risks

- Documentation

## Planning Phase Overview

- PM gets assigned

- Project goals, scope, and deliverables have to be approved

- Team members get assigned

- Sign off on project charter

### Benefits of Planning

- Understand the work needed to achieve your goals

- Coordinate efforts and timelines with other teams, contractors, and vendors

- Understand and prepare for risks

- Get buy-in from key members of the teams

- Demonstrates to stakeholders that the team is taking care to start the project with a detailed plan.

### Launching the Planning Phase

Usually involves the following:

- Budget

- Schedule

- Risk management plan

**Project kick-off meeting**: The first meeting in which a project team comes together to ground everyone in a shared vision, gain a shared understanding of the project's goals and scope, and to understand each person's individual roals within the team.

**Kick-off meeting agenda**:

- Introductions

- Backgounds
	
	- How the project came to be

	- Why the project matters

	- Shared vision

- Goals and scope

	- In-scope and out-of-scope

	- Target launch date

	- Milestone

- Roles

	- Everyone is clear about their roles and responsibilities

- Collaboration

	- Shared tools and docs

	- Communication mediums and protocols

- What comes next

	- Set expectations

- Questions from group

**Best Practices**

- Ask a teammate to take notes on key points and action items.

- After the meeting, send a follow up email that summarizes the key points and outcomes from the meeting, and any action items to attendees.

- Invite attendees to reach out for queries.

### Tasks and milestones

**Milestone**: An important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.

**Task** An activity that needs to bee accomplished within a set period of time.

One or more task completions may lead to the completion of a milestone and similarly one or more milestone completions may lead to the goal.

Setting milestones gives you a clear understanding of the amount of work your project will require.

#### Setting milestones

- Top-down Scheduling: The PM lays out the higher-level milestones, then works to break down the effort into project tasks. The PM works with their team to ensure all tasks are captured.

- Bottom-up scheduling: PM looks at all the tasks that need to be done and then rolls them into milestones.

### Work breakdown structure

WBS: A tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed.

After creating a WBS, you will have:

- Sets of discrete project tasks that ladder up to each of your milestones.

- Team members assigned to each task

After creating a WBS, you will have:

- Sets of discrete project tasks that ladder up to each of your milestones.

- Team members assigned to each task.

To assign tasks between 2 or more team members with the same roles, take into consideration each person's familiarity with the tasks at hand.

### Project Plan

Essential elements:

- Tasks

- milestones

- Team

- docs

- Time

### Time Estimates

**Time estimation**: A prediction of the total amount of time required to complete a task.

**Effort estimation**: A prediction of the amount of difficulty of active work required to complete a task.

Example: Effort estimate for painting a wall maybe 30 mins, but the time estimate for the task will be 24 hours because it takes into account the total time taken for the wall to be ready for use aka drying of paint included.

**Unrealistic effort estimate**: When you've underestimated the amount of time it'll take to complete a task.

To avoid unrealistic estimates, communicate with the teammates working on the task as they will have the most realistic understanding of the amount of work required to complete a task, and will be able to provide you with the best estimate.

**Buffer**: Extra time added to the end of a task or project to account for unexpected slowdowns or delays in work progress. Types include:

- Task Buffers: To be used primarily for tasks that are out of the project team's control. Ex: things that rely on external factors like deliveries of products before commencing work etc. To be used sparingly for tasks within the project team's control.

- Project Buffers

### Capacity planning and Critical path

**Capacity**: The amount of work that the people or resources assigned to the project can reasonably complete in a set period of time.

**Capacity Planning**: Refers to the act of allocating people and resources to project tasks, and determining whether or not you have the necessary resources required to complete the work on time.

**Critical Path**: The list of project milestones you must reach in order to meet the project goal on schedule, as well as the mandatory tasks that contribute to the completion of each milestone.

It is the brare minimum number of taks and milestones you need to reach your project goal.

WBS compliments Critical path creation.

- Identify which tasks can happen in parallel vs which can happen sequentially.

- Determine which project tasks have a fixed start date.

- Determine which project tasks have an earliest start date.

- Identify if a task has float (also called slack).

**Float**: Amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the project outcome.

Tasks on the critical path should have **zero** float.

**Soft skills**: Personal characteristics that help people work effectively with others.

- Asking the right Questions

- Negotiating effectively

- Practicing empathy

### Developing a Project Schedule

An anchor of a good project plan is a clear schedule, containing all the tasks of a project, their owners, and when they need to be completed.

**Gantt Chart**: Horizontal char that maps out the project schedule.

### Project Plan best practices

- Carefully review deliverables, milestones and tasks.

- Give yourself time to plan.

- Recognize and plan for the inevitable: things will go wrong.

- Stay curious

- Champion your plan.

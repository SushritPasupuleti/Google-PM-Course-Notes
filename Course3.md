### Launching the Planning Phase

Usually involves the following:

- Budget

- Schedule

- Risk management plan

**Project kick-off meeting**: The first meeting in which a project team comes together to ground everyone in a shared vision, gain a shared understanding of the project's goals and scope, and to understand each person's individual roals within the team.

**Kick-off meeting agenda**:

- Introductions

- Backgounds
	
	- How the project came to be

	- Why the project matters

	- Shared vision

- Goals and scope

	- In-scope and out-of-scope

	- Target launch date

	- Milestone

- Roles

	- Everyone is clear about their roles and responsibilities

- Collaboration

	- Shared tools and docs

	- Communication mediums and protocols

**Best Practices**

- Ask a teammate to take notes on key points and action items.

- After the meeting, send a follow up email that summarizes the key points and outcomes from the meeting, and any action items to attendees.

- Invite attendees to reach out for queries.

### Tasks and milestones

**Milestone**: An important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.

**Task** An activity that needs to bee accomplished within a set period of time.

One or more task completions may lead to the completion of a milestone and similarly one or more milestone completions may lead to the goal.

Setting milestones gives you a clear understanding of the amount of work your project will require.

#### Setting milestones

- Top-down Scheduling: The PM lays out the higher-level milestones, then works to break down the effort into project tasks. The PM works with their team to ensure all tasks are captured.

- Bottom-up scheduling: PM looks at all the tasks that need to be done and then rolls them into milestones.

### Work breakdown structure

WBS: A tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed.

After creating a WBS, you will have:

- Sets of discrete project tasks that ladder up to each of your milestones.

- Team members assigned to each task

After creating a WBS, you will have:

- Sets of discrete project tasks that ladder up to each of your milestones.

- Team members assigned to each task.

To assign tasks between 2 or more team members with the same roles, take into consideration each person's familiarity with the tasks at hand.

### Tracking and Measuring Project Progress

**Tracking**: A method of following the progress of project activities.

**Deviation**: Anything that alters your original course of action. Deviations from the project plan can be positive or negative.

Tracking allows for transparency by making information accessible, and transparency is essential for accurate decision-making.

Tracking keeps all team members and stakeholders in touch with deadlines and goals.

Tracking is also curcial for recognizing risks and issues that can derail your progress.

Tracking helps build confidence that the project is set to be delivered on time, in scope, and within budget.

#### Common items to track

- Project schedule

- Status of action items, key tasks and activities

- Progress towards milestones

- Costs

- Key decisions, changes, dependencies and risks to the project

#### Tracking Methods

- GANTT Chart

	- Useful for staying on schedule

	- Useful for projects with many dependencies, tasks, activities, or milestones.

	- Useful for larger project teams

- Roadmap

	- Useful for high-level tracking of large milestones.

	- Useful for illustrating how a project should evolve over time.

- Burndown chart

	- Useful for projects that require a granular, broken-down look at each task

	- Useful for projects where finishing on time is the top priority


**Tips**: Use a combination of the above methods to effectively track during each phase of the lifecycle. Ex: Gantt chart for initial scope work and burndown chart as you approach a key deadline or launch.

#### Changes

**Change**: Anything that alters or impacts the tasks, structures, or processes within a project.

Types of changes:

- New or changing dependencies

- Changing priorities

- Capacity and people

- Limitations on budget and resources

- Scope creep

- Force majeure

#### Identifying and tracking dependencies

**Dependencies**: The links that connect one project task to another and often the greatest source of risk to a project.

**Internal Dependencies**: The relationship between two tasks within the same project.

**External Dependencies**: Tasks that are reliant on outside factors, like regulatory agencies or other projects.

**Mandatory Dependencies**: Tasks that are legally or contractually required.

**Discretionary Dependencies**: Tasks that could occur on their own, but the team chose to make them reliant on one another.

**Dependency Management**: The process of managing interrelated tasks and resources within the project to ensure the overall project is completed successfully, on time, and in budget.

Once dependencies have been identified via a brainstorm, they must be noted and a risk register must be prepared.

**Risk Register**: A table or chart that contains your list of risks and dependencies.

**Risk Exposure**: A way to measure the potential future loss resulting from a specific activity or event.

##### ROAM Technique

- Resolved

- Owned

- Accepted

- Mitigated

Categorize risks based on these criteria.

### Escalating issues

The process of enlisting the help of higher level project leadership or management to remove an obstacle, clarify or reinforce priorities, and validate next steps.

- Act as checks and balances

- Generate speedy decision-making

- Reduce frustrations

- Encourage participation

Escalation standards should be setup before starting work on the project.

Escalate at first sign or critical issues which may:

- Cause a delay on a major milestone

- Cause budget overruns

- Can result in loss of customer

- Can push back completion date

#### Escalation mail tips

- Maintain a friendly tone

- State your connection to the project (when relevant)

- Explain the problem

- Explain the consequences

- Propose a course of action and make a request

### Quality Management and Continuous improvement

**Quality**: When you fulfill the outlined requirements for the deliverable and meet or exceed the needs or expectations of your customers.

**Quality Standards**: Provide requirements, specifications, or guidelines that can be used to ensure that products, processes, or services are fit for achieving the desired outcome. Set them at the beginning of the project.

**Quality Planning**: The actions of the project manager or the team to establish a process for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project as a whole.

Coming up with a quality plan may involve answering:

- What outcomes do my customers want?

- What does quality look like for them?

- How can I meet their expectations?

- How will I determine if the quality measure will lead to project success?

**Quality Assurance**: Evaluating if your project is moving towards delivering a high-quality service or product. QA happens throughout the project lifecycle.

**Quality Control**: Involves monitoring project results and delivery to determine if they are meeting desired results or not.

### Fostering Customer Relationships

The key to foster a good relationship with the customer involves:

- Negotiation

- Empathetic listening

- Trust-building

Ask open-ended questions and actively listen to understand the customers' current state versus their desired state.

Set clear expectations about when you'll communicate certain things to customers.

### Measuring Customer satisfaction

- **Feedback surveys**: Users provide feedback on features of your product that they like/dislike.

- **User acceptance tests**: Helps a business make sure a product or solution works for its users.
	
	- Welcome users and thank them for participating

	- Present your product to the team

	- Start UAT test cases

	- **Critical user journey**: The sequence of stepsa user follows to accomplish tasks in your product.

	- Walk users through a demo

	- Identify edge cases

	- Recap findings, identify issues, prioritize which issues should be addressed first.

### Continuous improvement and Process improvement

**Continuous Improvement**: An ongoing effort to improve products or services. It begins by recognizing when processes and tasks need to be:

- Created

- Eliminated

- Improved

**Process Improvement**: The practice of identifying, analyzing, and improving existing processes to enhance the performance of your team and develop best practices, or to optimize consumer experiences.

### Data-driven improvement frameworks

Techniques used to make decisions based on actual data.

**DMAIC**: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control

**PDCA**: A four-step process that focuses on identifying a problem, fixing that issue, assessing whether the fix was successful, and fine tuning the final fix.

Plan, Do, Check, Act

### Retrospectives

A workshop or meeting that gives project teams time to reflect on a project.

- Encourage team building.

- Facilitate improved collaboration.

- Promote positive changes.

The emphasis is on continuous improvement and change, instead of recycling old and potentially bad habits, procedures, and processes.

Reasons to hold a retro:

- Missed deadlines or expectations.

- Miscommunications between stakeholders.

- Reached end of a sprint.

- Product launches and landings.

- Record key lessons that other people can learn from.

### Tracking and Measuring Project Progress

**Tracking**: A method of following the progress of project activities.

**Deviation**: Anything that alters your original course of action. Deviations from the project plan can be positive or negative.

Tracking allows for transparency by making information accessible, and transparency is essential for accurate decision-making.

Tracking keeps all team members and stakeholders in touch with deadlines and goals.

Tracking is also curcial for recognizing risks and issues that can derail your progress.

Tracking helps build confidence that the project is set to be delivered on time, in scope, and within budget.

#### Common items to track

- Project schedule

- Status of action items, key tasks and activities

- Progress towards milestones

- Costs

- Key decisions, changes, dependencies and risks to the project

#### Tracking Methods

- GANTT Chart

	- Useful for staying on schedule

	- Useful for projects with many dependencies, tasks, activities, or milestones.

	- Useful for larger project teams

- Roadmap

	- Useful for high-level tracking of large milestones.

	- Useful for illustrating how a project should evolve over time.

- Burndown chart

	- Useful for projects that require a granular, broken-down look at each task

	- Useful for projects where finishing on time is the top priority


**Tips**: Use a combination of the above methods to effectively track during each phase of the lifecycle. Ex: Gantt chart for initial scope work and burndown chart as you approach a key deadline or launch.

#### Changes

**Change**: Anything that alters or impacts the tasks, structures, or processes within a project.

Types of changes:

- New or changing dependencies

- Changing priorities

- Capacity and people

- Limitations on budget and resources

- Scope creep

- Force majeure

#### Identifying and tracking dependencies

**Dependencies**: The links that connect one project task to another and often the greatest source of risk to a project.

**Internal Dependencies**: The relationship between two tasks within the same project.

**External Dependencies**: Tasks that are reliant on outside factors, like regulatory agencies or other projects.

**Mandatory Dependencies**: Tasks that are legally or contractually required.

**Discretionary Dependencies**: Tasks that could occur on their own, but the team chose to make them reliant on one another.

**Dependency Management**: The process of managing interrelated tasks and resources within the project to ensure the overall project is completed successfully, on time, and in budget.

Once dependencies have been identified via a brainstorm, they must be noted and a risk register must be prepared.

**Risk Register**: A table or chart that contains your list of risks and dependencies.

**Risk Exposure**: A way to measure the potential future loss resulting from a specific activity or event.

##### ROAM Technique

- Resolved

- Owned

- Accepted

- Mitigated

Categorize risks based on these criteria.

### Escalating issues

#### Escalation mail tips

- Maintain a friendly tone

- State your connection to the project (when relevant)

- Explain the problem

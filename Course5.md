## Overview

- History of Agile

- Introduction to Scrum

- Core roles that make up a Scrum team

- Best practices for Scrum

### Agile Introduction

Agile emphasizes on the following principles:

- Being able to move quickly and easily

- Flexibility and the willingness and ability to change and adapt

It embodies "agility" and is based on the Agile Manifesto.

The Manifesto is a collection of four values and 12 principles that define the mindset that all Agile teams should adopt.

### Agile vs Waterfall

- Agile was created in response to the strict linear process of Waterfall.

- Agile embraces the reality that the world, customer markets, and users are uncertain and unpredictable.

- Agile aims to get customer feedback more quickly.

- Working with an agile mindset means always finding ways to work more efficiently by focusing on streamlining the process without reducing product quality or value.

- Agile aims to reduce waste.

### Four values of the Agile Manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

- Working software over documentation

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

- Responding to change over following a plan

### 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto

The 12 principles are categorized into 4 themes, which are:

- **Value Delivery**: Delivering the work as quickly as possible in order to get feedback and mitigate time risk.

	- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

	- Deliver working software frequently, from couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.

	- Working software is the primary measure of progress.

	- Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.

	- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

- **Business collaboration**: Collaborating with your customers helps the team get critical business information immediately, allowing them to adjust and adapt to any new information instantly.

	- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

	- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

- **Team Dynamics and Culture**: Create an effective team culture that is inclusive, supportive and empowering.

	- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

	- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within the development team is face-to-face conversation.

	- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

	- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

- **Retrospectives and Continuous Learning**: 

	- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effetive, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Adopting an Agile mindset

**VUCA**: An accronym that defines the conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world.

- **V**olatility: Rate of change and churn in a business or situation.

- **U**ncertainity: The lack of predictability or high potential of surprise.

- **C**omplexity: The high number of interrelated forces, issues, organizations, and factors that would influence the project.

- **A**mbiguity: Refers to the possibility of misunderstanding the conditions and root causes of events or circumstances.

### Scrum

**Product backlog**: The central artifact in Scrum, where all possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are captured for the team to work on.

**Sprint**: A time-boxed iteration in Scrum where work is done.

**Daily Scrum**: A meeting of 15 or fewer minutes every day of the Sprint.

**Scrum Master**:

- Responsible for ensuring the team lives by Agile values and principles.

- Responsible for ensuring the team follows the processes and practices that the team agreed to.

- Responsible for sharing information to the larger project team.

- Responsible for helping the team focus on doing their best work.

**Product Owner**:

- Responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the team.

- Responsible for the inventory of work and final say on how to prioritize the work.

**Development Team**:

- Resposible for how a team will deliver that product.

### Kanban, XP, and Lean

**Kanban**:

- Provides transparent and visual feedback.

- Ensures the project team only accepts a sustainable amount of in progress work.

**Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limit**: Tasks are limited to what the team can currently handle during a certain amount of time.

**XP**:

- Aims to improve product quality and the ability to respond to changing customer needs.

- Takes best practices for the development process to "extreme" levels.

- Leverage practices like: Pair Programming, CI/CD, Avoid Big Design Up Front, Write Tests not Requirements.

### Scrum

Agile is the foundational philosophy and mindset, while Scrum is a framework that materializes or brings that philosophy to life.

#### 3 Scrum Pillars

- **Transparency**: The team is open and honest about what they are doing and why.

- **Inspection**: The team is accountable for their work and the quality of their work.

- **Adaptation**: The team is able to adapt to changing circumstances and new challenges.

#### 5 Scrum Values

- Commitment

- Courage

- Focus

- Openness

- Respect

#### Scrum Master traits

Promotes and supports the scrum process by helping everyone understand and implement scrum.

Responsibilities include:

- Coaching team members on Agile and Scrum practices, rules and values.

- Helping to find ways to manage the Product Backlog.

- Ensuring the team is on track to deliver the product on time.

- Helping remove blockers.

### Product Owner

Ensure the team is building the right product for the customer.

Responsibilities include:

- Maximizing the value of the product.

- Act as voice of the customer.

- Help the team understand why their work matters within the overall goal and mission of the project.

- Prioritize the Product Backlog to optimize the team's efforts.

### Implementing Scrum

**Product Backlog**: The single authoritative source for things that a team works on. It contains all of the features, requirements, and activities associated with deliverables to achieve the goal of the project.

- Living artifact: It is constantly evolving and changing.

- Owned and adjusted by the product owner.

- Prioritized list of features.

### Writing User Stories

**User Stories**: Short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user.

Elements of a user story:

- User

- Action

- Benefit

> As a **<user role>** I want this **<action>** so that I can **<benefit>**.

Stories should have the following characteristics:

- **I**nvest

- **N**egotiable

- **V**aluable

- **E**stimable

- **S**mall

- **T**estable

or **INVEST**

**Epic**: A group or collection of user stories.

**Acceptance Criteria**: The checklist you will use to decide whether the user story is done.

### Backlog Refinement

Review the product backlog to ensure:

- It contains the appropriate items, and that nothing new is needed or nothing needs to be removed.

- That the items are prioritized by the Product Owner, this is also calleed setting the order field

- That the items at the top of the backlog are ready for delivery with clear acceptance criteria.

- And that the backlog items include estimates or an informed assessment about how much work a particular backlog item will be.

**Estimation**: Through estimation we can find out how much work we have ahead of us.

**Relative Estimation**: Instead of trying to determine exactly how long a task will take, we compare the effort of that task to another task, and that becomes the estimate.

**Tip**: Use fibonacci numbers to assign story points.

### Sprints

Within a sprint, the amount of work is planned based on historical capacity of the team and is made ready for the sprint planning event.

**Timeboxes**: A timebox is a fixed period of time during which work is done.

Sprints can be anywhere from 1 week to 1 month long, to choose consider:

- The frequency with which new changes may come in.

- How much focused time your solution developers need to work on the project.

### Sprint planning

The entire scrum team comes together and meets to confirm how much capacity, meaning time and people, are available during this sprint.

**Definition of Done**: Refers to an agreed upon set of items that must be completed before a user story or backlog item can be considered complete.

Examples:

- Code or solution itself is reviewed and approved by the team.

- The product or unit tests are written and pass.

- Documentation is complete.

- All user stories are complete.

- The product owner has approved the work.

### Daily Scrum and Sprint Review

**Daily Scrum**: A 15-minute meeting that happens every day of the sprint to synchronize the team's work and identify any impediments.

**Sprint Review**: A meeting with the entire Scrum Team where the product is demonstrated in order to determine which aspects are finished and which aren't.

It covers:

- Exploration of which items should be considered done in the Product Backlog.

- Demonstrate and inspect the Product.

**Product Increment**: The sum of all the work completed during the sprint.

### Sprint Retrospectives

**Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting that happens at the end of the sprint to inspect how the sprint went and identify ways to improve. Can last upto 3 hours.

Talk about:

- What's working or not working for the team regarding the processes, people and tools.

- What improvements are worth exploring in the next sprint.

- And what improvements were put in place for the last sprint? Were they effective? Why ?

Things to achieve:

- Be blameless by creating a safe environment for everyone to share their thoughts, feedback and ideas.

- Partipation by everyone on the team.

- Balance on the negative and positive feedback.

- Take action on the feedback.

### Velocity and Burndown Charts

**Burndown Chart**: A chart that shows the amount of work remaining in a sprint over time.

**Velocity**: The amount of work a team can complete in a sprint.

Dos and Don'ts for velocity:

- Do: Be careful when sharing velocity with external stakeholders.

- Don't: Use velocity as a performance metric.

- Don't: Use velocity as a comprison metric.

- Do: Proceed with caution when using velocity to predict future sprints.

### Maximizing value-driven delivery

**Value** can mean different things for each customer based on what they expect the product to accomplish.

- Build the right thing.

- Build the thing right.

- Run the thing right.

### Value Roadmap

- An agile way of mapping out the product development process.

- Can be used on all types of businesses.

- A guide that demonstrates

	- Where to go

	- How to get there

	- What to accomplish along the way

- Helps the team explain the vision of the product.

- Used to identify important milestones.

**Product Vision**: A description of the product that describes the problem it solves and the value it provides.

**Product Roadmap**: A high-level plan that describes the features and functionality that will be delivered over a period of time.

**Release Plan**: Contains estimates for the work that will be done in a release and when each release will be delivered.

- Release goal

- List of backlog items

- Estimated Release Date

- Other relevant dates that impact the release

### Facilitating Organizational Change

Understanding organizational culture and the change management process is crucial when introducing new ways of working.

**Organizational Culture**: The shared values, beliefs, and assumptions that influence how people behave in an organization.

**Change Management**: The process of planning and supporting individuals and organizations in making organizational change.

Create a sense of ownership:

- Find an executive sponsor who also feels a sense of ownership for the change.

- Having buy-in from someone at the top increases your chances of successfully driving change.

Create a sense of urgency:

- Ask questions about what's working and what's not working right now.

	- What is preventing us from providing the best possible experience for our customers?

	- What is allowing our competitors to outpace us?

	- How can we help our teams become more productive and support their work?

### Agile Introduction

Agile emphasizes on the following principles:

- Being able to move quickly and easily

- Flexibility and the willingness and ability to change and adapt

It embodies "agility" and is based on the Agile Manifesto.

The Manifesto is a collection of four values and 12 principles that define the mindset that all Agile teams should adopt.

### Agile vs Waterfall

- Agile was created in response to the strict linear process of Waterfall.

- Agile embraces the reality that the world, customer markets, and users are uncertain and unpredictable.

- Agile aims to get customer feedback more quickly.

- Working with an agile mindset means always finding ways to work more efficiently by focusing on streamlining the process without reducing product quality or value.

- Agile aims to reduce waste.

### Four values of the Agile Manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

- Working software over documentation

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

- Responding to change over following a plan

### 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto

The 12 principles are categorized into 4 themes, which are:

- **Value Delivery**: Delivering the work as quickly as possible in order to get feedback and mitigate time risk.

	- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

	- Deliver working software frequently, from couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.

	- Working software is the primary measure of progress.

	- Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.

	- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

- **Business collaboration**: Collaborating with your customers helps the team get critical business information immediately, allowing them to adjust and adapt to any new information instantly.

	- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

	- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

- **Team Dynamics and Culture**: Create an effective team culture that is inclusive, supportive and empowering.

	- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

	- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within the development team is face-to-face conversation.

	- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

	- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

- **Retrospectives and Continuous Learning**: 

	- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effetive, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Adopting an Agile mindset

**VUCA**: An accronym that defines the conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world.

- **V**olatility: Rate of change and churn in a business or situation.

- **U**ncertainity: The lack of predictability or high potential of surprise.

- **C**omplexity: The high number of interrelated forces, issues, organizations, and factors that would influence the project.

- **A**mbiguity: Refers to the possibility of misunderstanding the conditions and root causes of events or circumstances.

### Scrum

**Product backlog**: The central artifact in Scrum, where all possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are captured for the team to work on.

**Sprint**: A time-boxed iteration in Scrum where work is done.

**Daily Scrum**: A meeting of 15 or fewer minutes every day of the Sprint.

**Scrum Master**:

- Responsible for ensuring the team lives by Agile values and principles.

- Responsible for ensuring the team follows the processes and practices that the team agreed to.

- Responsible for sharing information to the larger project team.

- Responsible for helping the team focus on doing their best work.

**Product Owner**:

- Responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the team.

- Responsible for the inventory of work and final say on how to prioritize the work.

**Development Team**:

- Resposible for how a team will deliver that product.

### Kanban, XP, and Lean

**Kanban**:

- Provides transparent and visual feedback.

- Ensures the project team only accepts a sustainable amount of in progress work.

**Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limit**: Tasks are limited to what the team can currently handle during a certain amount of time.

**XP**:

- Aims to improve product quality and the ability to respond to changing customer needs.

- Takes best practices for the development process to "extreme" levels.

- Leverage practices like: Pair Programming, CI/CD, Avoid Big Design Up Front, Write Tests not Requirements.

- Build the right team

- Measure progress (Letting the team know how much they've accomplished is great for morale)

#### Leadership and team dynamics

Strong interpersonal skills are very important. Influencing without authority, wherein a PM guides the team to complete the work without acting as the boss.

A good relationship with all stakeholders is equally important since it is through them that you get the most information about the vision and goal of the project while also ensuring the team is on the right track.

Some key interpersonal skills:

#### Project Management Methodologies

Set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle.

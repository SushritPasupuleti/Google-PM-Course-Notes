Track all the above from start to finish of a project on a platform of your choice.

#### Budgeting and Controlling costs

- Monitor and Manage Budget (Spreadsheets)

Project Tasks are activities that must be accomplished within a set period of time by the team.

Creat a doc to track all changes.

- Empowering the team (Let the make decisions, let them communicate with stakeholders and let them feel trusted and responsible)

#### Working with Cross Functional Teams

Teams that consist of diverse set of people in terms of backgrounds, expertise and job functions. It can be a challenge, but only by working with a proper synergy and utilizing their strengths can a project be successfully completed.

- Clarify Goals (Define expectations, role, budget, timelines and overall place in the project)

- Build the right team

- Measure progress (Letting the team know how much they've accomplished is great for morale)

- Recognize Efforts
